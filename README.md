Offensive Security Lab Setup

This repository documents the setup, configuration, and fine-tuning of a local offensive security lab using VirtualBox on a Windows host. The lab includes commonly used vulnerable machines and tools such as Kali Linux, Metasploitable3, BWAPP, Commando VM, DC01 (Domain Controller), and pfSense as a firewall/router.

Everything was configured manually over time, with many challenges and fixes along the way â€” documented here for others setting up similar labs.
