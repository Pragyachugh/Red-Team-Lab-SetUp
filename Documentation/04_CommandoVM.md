**INSTALLATION PROCESS FOR COMMANDO VM** REQUIRES DOWNLOADING WINDOWS 11 OR 10 BUT IT WORKS BETTER ON WINDOWS 10 SO WE WOULD DOWNLOAD WINDOWS 10 IN VM.

WINDOWS 10 DOWNLOAD:
- Download media creation tool for windows 10.
- Run the executable file.
- Choose the options that suit your requirements.
- Download the .iso image in your desired location.

NOW, VM SETUP :
- Create new machine.
- Add the desired .iso image and name in Windows 10 for now.
- Keep storage upto 90-100 gb preferably because commando vm is a heavy file.
- Finish the setup and do the changes in advanced settings like enable 3D acceleration , allow bidirectional movements, enable only 1 network adapter for now i.e. bridged adapter for internet access.
- Finally you're ready to start the machine.

Inside Windows 10:
- Clean up the desktop as per your preferences. I removed microsoft edge, search bar, etc. from taskbar. You can clean it as per your preference.
- Now update windows from settings > update and security.
- Insert Guest Addition CD Image in your setup.
- In File Explorer > go to This PC > Then Click on virtual box guest addition drive.
- From here install 64 bit guest addition application of virtualBox.
- In control Panel, disable windows defender wall.
